# Project Overview

*London Bike Rentals Analysis - Dataset Overview and Transformation*

*This analysis focuses on the "london_merged.csv" dataset, which contains information about bike rentals in London. The dataset consists of 17,414 rows and 10 columns. The analysis includes exploration of unique values in the weather_code and season columns, data transformation steps such as renaming columns and mapping categorical values, and the final export of the transformed dataset to an Excel file named "london_bikes_final.xlsx". The transformed dataset was used for further analysis and visualization in Tableau.*


## Some features of Tableau that were used to create the London bike ride visualization:

- Data Source Connectivity: I connected the "london_merged.csv" dataset to Tableau to access and analyze the bike ride data.

- Drag-and-Drop Interface: I used Tableau's intuitive drag-and-drop interface to select and place the relevant data fields, such as timestamp, count, temperature, humidity, and weather, onto the visualization canvas.

- Interactive Charts and Graphs: I leveraged Tableau's wide range of chart types, including line charts and bar charts, to represent the bike ride data effectively. These interactive visualizations allowed viewers to explore and analyze the data.

- Filters and Parameters: I applied filters and parameters in Tableau to focus on specific time periods, weather conditions, or other criteria of interest. This interactive feature allowed viewers to customize the visualizations and gain insights based on their preferences.

- Calculated Fields: I utilized Tableau's calculated fields feature to perform calculations on the data. For example, I calculated average bike rentals per hour, derived the difference between real temperature and feels-like temperature, and calculated the percentage of bike rentals on weekends.

- Storytelling and Dashboards: I created interactive dashboards and stories in Tableau to present a narrative and guide viewers through the data. These dashboards combined multiple visualizations to communicate key findings and trends in the London bike ride data effectively.

- Mapping and Geographic Analysis: I used Tableau's mapping capabilities to plot bike rental locations on a map and visualize spatial patterns. This feature allowed me to perform geographic analysis and gain insights about bike rentals in different areas of London.

- Color and Size Encoding: I applied color and size encoding in Tableau to highlight and compare different dimensions of the data. For example, I color-coded bike rentals based on weather conditions and sized the data points based on the count of bike rentals.

- Tooltips and Interactivity: I incorporated tooltips and interactivity in Tableau to enhance the user experience. Viewers could hover over data points to view additional information or interact with the visualizations to explore the data further.
